				<h4><div class="shadow">When I first held you I was cold<br>
					A melting snowman I was told<br>
					But there was no-one there to hold before<br>
					I swore that I would be alone for ever more<br>
					Wow look at you now<br>
					Flowers in the window<br>
					It's such a lovely day<br>
					And I'm glad you feel the same<br>
					Cause to stand up, out in the crowd</div><br>
					<span>You are one in a million<br>
					And I love you so</span><br>
					<div class="shadow">Lets watch the flowers grow</div><br>
					There is no reason to feel bad<br>
					But there are many seasons to feel glad, sad, mad<br>
					It's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold<br>
					But I am here to help you with the load<br>
					Wow look at you now<br>
					Flowers in the window<br>
					It's such a lovely day<br>
					And I'm glad you feel the same<br>
					Cause to stand up, out in the crowd<br>
					You are one in a million<br>
					And I love you so<br>
					Lets watch the flowers grow<br>
					So now we're here and now is fine<br>
					So far away from there and there is time, time, time<br>
					To plant new seeds and watch them grow<br>
					So there'll be flowers in the window when we go<br>
					Wow look at us now<br>
					Flowers in the window<br>
					It's such a lovely day<br>
					And I'm glad you feel the same<br>
					Cause to stand up, out in the crowd<br>
					You are one in a million,<br>
					And I love you so<br>
					Lets watch the flowers grow<br>
					Wow look at you now<br>
					Flowers in the window<br>
					Its such a lovely day<br>

					And I love you so<br>
					Let's watch the flowers grow<br>
